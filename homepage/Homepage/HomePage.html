    <p class="text_column">The industry placement has no doubt helped me to develop my future, I applied for a graduate job with the same company and thankfully I secured a job there. I will be joining the Rolls Royce Graduate Scheme in Birmingham. I’ll be starting as a Graduate Software Engineer, but I will have the option to switch between departments to see where I want to pursue my career&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sadaf Satar, BSc (Hons) Computer Science</p>
    <p class="text_column">Computer Science at the University of Bradford We believe that technology should benefit everyone, and that everyone should have the opportunity to work within an exciting and future-defining discipline. Our courses have been carefully designed to promote openness and inclusivity for all – we do not require students to have previously studied IT or Computer Science A-Levels or BTECs. Our curriculum begins from first principles, both practical and theoretical, to bring everyone up to a high standard of knowledge and expertise while still challenging and motivating those with previous subject knowledge through open-ended and extensible practical tasks. We strongly believe that employability and practical skills, built on solid theoretical foundations, are critical for student success after graduating from our University. We embed the development of employer-focussed skills and experience into our programmes in many ways. Our module contents and curricula are built around input and feedback from our Industry Advisory Board, providing a direct line for industry experts to shape our taught content. We also embed opportunities to work on live industry projects directly into our modules, with projects available to students from both internal and external group to the University that have real problems to be solved, requiring students to produce real solutions and gain real experience.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="text_column">&nbsp;Our facilities are impressive, with several large and small labs filled with dual-screen, dual boot (Windows and Linux) systems packed with industry standard software. Our specialised labs, such as the Ethical Hacking lab and the Internet of Things lab, allow students to build their skills within these key areas of growth, in a structured way, through taught modules. Students working on supervised projects can experiment with cutting edge technology, including VR headsets, Raspberry Pi microcomputers, EEG headsets and many more. We provide a range of online facilities to support independent learning, including our Virtual Learning Environment which gives you access to learning materials and collaborative learning tools 24/7, anywhere in the world. We also provide virtual server technology using in-house hardware to allow students to use our operating systems remotely.</p>
